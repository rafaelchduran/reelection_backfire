\multicolumn{4}{p{1.5\textwidth}}{\footnotesize{Notes: Coefficients show IW estimators following \citet{abraham_sun_2020}. Two relative time periods (lag 8 and 1) are removed to avoid collinearity problems noted by \citet{abraham_sun_2020}. Standard errors in parentheses are clustered at the state level for estimates in saturaded model. Significance-level: $^{***}$ 1\%; $^{**}$ 5\%; and $^*$ 10\%, that refer to two-sided t-test with the null hypothesis equal to 0 for each relative time period. $^a$ Even columns with outcomes with missing values where replaced by zeros assuming no activity was registered. $^b$ State-level controls include governor winning margin in last pre-treatment election and an indicator of whether the governor's party is the same as the federal incumbent party.}} \\
