	Annote = {`political identities and armed conflict in colombia'

fn 1: `By political identity we mean the experience of an individual or colelctive actor of a shared social relation in which at least one of the parties including thire parties is an indivdual or an organization that controls a significant concentration of coercive means. 

82-83
``Concretely it is suggested that the form of state centralization in operation until 1988 contriubted to this radicalization as well. [It] limited the possibilities of access to local power of minority groups or those that lacked a national presence. This reduced the opportunities for agreements, alliances, and in general political competition and interplay at the local level. 

84
``The initiative passed from the peasant organizations, urban reformers and revolutionaries to the large estate owners, cattle ranchers and businessmen, and the center of the debate moved from issues of access to material resources for dispossessed groups to the offer of security to wealthy owners.''

terms the identities and radical regional cultures ``invisible'' to the majority of approaches centered on a national analysis. 

`populating of territories by populations displaced as a result of polticial conflcit has recreated practices and discourses against central state dominion (Gonzalez 1994). 

lack of recognition by the center of these regional, radical identities has left them excluded from the political community{\ldots}

Regional civic movements between 1975-1985 were ``above all{\ldots}projects that affirmed a sense of local autonomy and resistance to a form of state intervention from the center that unbalanced the family economy: the policy of contorlling increases in the charges for public services from the center{\ldots}

85
The relationship between the guerrilla and the regional movements has been uneven, marked by ups and downs or open ruptures. However, the independent dynamic of each tended to affect the possibilities of the other, sometimes positively and at other times negatively. The beginning of the peace process during Belisario Betancur's government opened a space for these regional movements and the political fronts related to the armed groups. The dynamic of `dirty war' that overtook these negotiations made the electoral paricipation of these movements and groups uncertain, despite the new possibilities offered by decentralization and the constitutional reform.'' 

86
`{\ldots}once the first agreements were sigend, a multiplicity of regional actors and spokespersons emerged from the shadows --- those who had been marginalized through the practices and vluations of centralized power and two-party government and not recognized as equals.'' 

``They are represented as `extremists' or, in the case of peasants and land colonizers, as part of the `floating' population open to `revolutionary adventures' and to `agitators,' and therefore, lacking values associated with values and progress. This way of representing resistance to projects from the center as anarchical and irrational makes it eaasy to propose a solution - the pacifcying, order-bringing and rational presence of the central state. It places the responsibility for rebellion on the absence of this `cohesive' force without giving importance to the reasons for the protest.'' 

87 
military had operational independence in the periphery

``{\ldots}the counterinsurgency practices in the regions experiencing conflict, of sabotaging popular organization and impeding the development of organizing capacities, has led to the radicalization of political identities, has supported the continuance of civil societies with limited popular participation, and has facilitated the consolidation of elitist public cultures.'' 

88
``{\ldots}the form taken by this state presence has lead to the sharpening of these conflicts, to the weakening of the organizing possibilities of the affected groups among themselves and with the state agencies, and to suspicion about state intervention.'' 

failure of agricultural reform under Lleras Restrepo (66-70), led to invasions 1970-73, and Turbay's crackdowns

Lopez Michelsen (74-78; end of national front)

Betancour (82-86)

`According to the hypothesis of this work, for the peasants, the failure of the agrarian reform led by the state, the lack of state action to confront the impoverishing effects of the commercilaizaiton of agriculture and the market, and the use of repression to confront their demands in the face of local exploitation and domination, forged an experience of how power functions that helped to mold a radical political identity. This, once in contact with revolutionary proposals, found a shared vision of the world, of the history and place of the state, in which armed rebellion was the only possible way to construct a more just social order. 

`At the beginning of the 1980s, the repression in the countryside and of the urban unions gave the impression of stability and elite control over the local order.'' 

91
elite fragmentation
narcos investing
EPL expansion, extortion

ANUC and the Church continued organizing

92
Betancour, peace talks at end of 82 perceived as betrayal by the cattle ranchers. they reached out to the military.

93
by 1987, Castano `had his private army' and a new brigade in Monteria, the XI. 

first direct mayoral elections in 88 ``heated up the dispute for local bureaucratic power'' 

idea was to attack civilian base of guerrilla support. `Assuming a direct link between guerrilla groups and legal forces of social and political struggle, paramilitaries, self-defense groups and security forces annihiliated all possibilities of opposition and resistance in this department, without affecting the armed apparatus of the insurgent groups, the suppoed objective of their reaction. The FARC retreated{\ldots}'' 

In April 1988 the colelctive assassinations began. 

94
``The army justified their inability to protect the electoral participation of these groups, by alleging that if their comrades were kidnapping and undertaking extortion, they should pay the consequences, since they were only the `unarmed arm of subversion.' This discursive practice from position sof power vlaidated all types of attacks against members of these political groups.

1989, couldn't get a march organized

focus on the `enemy inside [within]'

95
`{\ldots}in this construction of `enemy,' those defined as leftists are seen an anonymous mass of undesirables and therefore `disposable people.' 

EPL negotiated so banana investors wouldn't leave

96
EPL worked with a Conservative in Cordoba

98 
calls AUC activity political cleansing

Castano - said ``Two-thirds of the guerrilla are unarmed members who operate as civliians and collaborate with teh guerrilla (Castro 96)

99
`{\ldots}since the scale of the confrontation has never been enough to `give rise to a political polarization on the whole' (Pecaut 1997), or a national representation of the political in terms of friend-enemy, these regional phenomena tend to be minimized and the tragedy of their populations to be overlooked.''
