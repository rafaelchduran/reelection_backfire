	\begin{abstract}    
	
A large literature has studied the electoral returns to incumbency. However, the incumbency return in the next election -whether positive or negative- masks an understudied dynamic between parties and their members: they can both be hated, both loved or asymmetrically liked by the constituency. This paper opens up the black box of incumbency by studying the effect of reelection on personal and partisan incumbency returns. To do so, I exploit the staggered implementation of an electoral reform that introduced reelection for local executives from 2014 to 2022 in Mexico, a party-centered system. I find that a seemingly null result hides an incumbency asymmetry: when citizens are able to reelect the incumbent a personal incumbency advantage follows, with parties suffering from an incumbency disadvantage. Contrary to past studies, a difference-in-discontinuity in close elections allows me to overcome methodological downfalls, primarily the difference in experience and ability between term limited and non non-term limited incumbents, as well as rule out the differential trends on electoral returns that localities may have. Results suggest the personal advantage to be driving positive incumbency returns when reelection exists even in party-centered systems.

       \captionsetup{justification=centering}
       
 \textbf{Note:} Figure \ref{fig:personal_vs_partisan} shows the average treatment effect of the Term Limit Reform on the probability of winning in the following election using a difference in discontinuity of close elections design. This average effect was estimated using the IW estimators following \citet{abraham_sun_2020} for each lead and lag relative to the first year a municipality implemented reelection. Optimal bandwidths following \citet{calonicoetal_2014} are used. This analysis identifies the party that wins at $t-1$ and studies the effect of this party barely winning (or losing) at $t$ on outcomes at election $t+1$ following \citet{klasnja_titiunik_2017}. I follow \citet{fowler_hall_2014} to decompose the incumbency advantage into the partisan and personal component. Red and blue points show that parallel trends hold, while hollow ones imply pretrends.
