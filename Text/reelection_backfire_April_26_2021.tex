Local incumbents up for reelection face a delegation puzzle with upper levels of government. In the presence of spillovers and sum costs, delegation of public good provision may increase its efficiency but cut down its use for electoral purposes. Not delegating allows incumbents to signal responsiveness and carry credit claiming activities to win votes but may generate an inefficient public good provision. A clear tradeoff between efficiency and electoral survival arises. This paper studies the effect of reelection incentives on delegation of public security provision to upper levels of government in a country overwhelmed by criminal wars, Mexico. To do so, I exploit the staggered implementation of an electoral reform that introduced reelection for local executives from 2014 to 2022. I find that mayors up for reelection decrease the delegation of public security to the Governor of their state relative to term limited mayors. This behavior is prominent in municipalities characterized with citizens concerned by narcotraffic and insecurity, and where they hold high levels of trust for police forces different from municipal ones. %those where citizens hold a high level of  trust of state or federal forces, and those where mayors’ parties are not aligned with upper level governments since in such citizens tend not to blame mayors harshly for public security provision inefficiencies. 
%By taking "the bull by the horns", mayors facing reelection signal responsiveness against crime, a hawkish type. 
As a result of this no-delegation behavior, a personal incumbency advantage follows, as well as public security underprovision and violence. 
Results suggest that delegation is not only a political decision but an electoral one, and that reelection incentives in party-centered systems  -like Mexico- may lead local executives to go local to signal responsiveness at the expense of efficient public good provision.

\section{Main Results}

Main takeaway: Reelection incentives decreased delegation of public security provision to the Governor.

\section{Robustness}

Main takeaways: 

1. Results are robust across multiple specifications and models.

Red points show that parallel trends hold, while hollow ones imply pretrends.

2. Results only present if upper-level government can compete in credit claiming locally (President never does this).

\section{Mechanisms}

Main takeaways: 

%Pull strategy:

1. Mayors facing reelection decrease the delegation of public security provision and traffic, but not other services.

 \textbf{Note:} Figure \ref{fig:services} shows the average treatment effect from t, t+1 and t+3 across multiple specifications. This average effect was estimated using the IW estimators following \citet{abraham_sun_2020} for each lead and lag relative to the first year a municipality implemented reelection. Red points show that parallel trends hold, while hollow ones imply pretrends. 
\end{figure}

2. Alignment: If you are aligned you have a lot to loose in terms of credit claim, especially if you are from the PRI. This should be smaller for alignment with President since you are not competing directly in terms of reputation in local politics. Lastly, we should see a greater negative effect if not aligned since citizens do not blame you as much por public security inefficiencies following \citet{ley_2017}.

3. a. Mayors facing reelection want to show responsiveness to constituents preferences. 
3. b. Mayors facing reelection sign security agreements when faced by problems "too big" or of the national order.

\section{Unintended consequences}

\subsection{Preferences for order and security}
1. PREFERENCES: citizens are more concerned about security but less about other things. Recall results are conditional on violence. So in the next election, they will look for another hawk. This ties to the incumbency advantage.

Filled points (squares) show that parallel trends hold, while hollow ones imply pretrends.

\subsection{Security underprovision and violence}
